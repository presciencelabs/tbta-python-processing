Title: Abraham dies.

Genesis 25:1 <<After Sarah died,>> Abraham married a woman named Keturah.

Taĩto: Iburaimu gũkua.

Genesis 25:1 <<Cara agũkua,>> Iburaimu a-gũrire mũka wetagwa Ketuura.



Genesis 25:2 Keturah gave birth to sons named Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

Genesis 25:2 Ketuura a-gĩre na ciana cia tũbĩcĩ ciĩtagwa Cimurani, Njogicani, Mendani, Mindiani, na Cuua.



Genesis 25:3 Jokshan had sons named Sheba and Dedan. Dedan's descendants were the Ashurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.

Genesis 25:3 Njogicani a-gĩre na abĩcĩ metagwa Ceba na Ndendani. Nciarwa cia Ndendani cia-rĩ aacuri, aretuci, na areumu.



Genesis 25:4 Midian had sons named Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these people were Abraham and Keturah's descendants.

Genesis 25:4 Mindiani a-gĩre na abĩcĩ metagwa Ebaa, Eberu, Anoku, Abinda, na Erũdaa. Antũ mama monthe ma-rĩ nciarwa cia Iburaimu na cia Ketuura.



Genesis 25:5 After Abraham died, Isaac inherited all of his things.

Genesis 25:5 Iburaimu agũkua, Icaka a-gaĩrwe into ciawe cionthe.



Genesis 25:6 But before Abraham died, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines. Then he told those sons to live in the eastern region so that they would be far from Isaac.

Genesis 25:6 Ĩndĩ mbere ya Iburaimu a-kua, a-nenkere abĩcĩ ma aka ma mbooro mawe ibeo. Rĩu akĩĩra abĩcĩ mau matũũre gĩcigoni kĩa mbarĩ ĩrĩa riũa rĩrathaga nĩ kenda megue marĩ baraca na Icaka.



Genesis 25:7 When Abraham was 175 years old, he died.

Genesis 25:7 Rĩrĩa Iburaimu a-rĩ na mĩaka ĩgana rĩ mĩrongo mũgwanja na ĩtano, a-kuire.



Genesis 25:8 When Abraham died, he was very old. While Abraham was living, he was very content. Literal Alternate: After Abraham died, he was with his ancestors.

Genesis 25:8 Rĩrĩa Iburaimu a-kuire, a-rĩ mũkũrũ mũno. A-rĩ ĩganĩra mũno rĩrĩa a-tũũraga. <Literal Alternate: Iburaimu agũkua, a-rĩ na cũcũ mawe.>



Genesis 25:9 Abraham's sons named Isaac and Ishmael buried him in a cave that was in the region named Machpelah. Machpelah was near Mamre. That cave was in a field that Abraham bought from Ephron. Ephron was the son of Zohar, who was a Hittite.

Genesis 25:9 Abĩcĩ ma Iburaimu metagwa Icaka na Icimairi ma-mũthikire ĩkurunguni rĩmwe rĩrĩa rĩa-rĩ gĩcigoni gĩetagwa Makubera. Makubera ya-rĩ bakubĩ na Mamure. Ĩkurungu rĩu rĩa-rĩ mũgũndani ũrĩa Iburaimu a-gũrĩte kuuma kwa Ebũroni. Ebũroni a-rĩ mũbĩcĩ wa Coa, ũrĩa wa-rĩ mũitite.



Genesis 25:10 Abraham bought that field from the Hittites. So he was buried in the same cave where he buried his wife named Sarah.

Genesis 25:10 Iburaimu a-gũrire kĩthaka kĩu kuuma kwa aitite. Kwogu akĩthikwa ĩkurunguni rĩmwe kũrĩa a-thikĩte mũka wawe wetagwa Cara.



Genesis 25:11 After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac was living near Beer-Lahai-Roi.

Genesis 25:11 Iburaimu agũkua, Ngai a-tharimire mũbĩcĩ wawe wetagwa Icaka. Icaka nĩ a-tũũraga bakubĩ na Bia-rai-roi.



Title: Ishmael has descendants.

Genesis 25:12 Ishmael was Abraham and Hagar's son. Hagar was Sarah's female slave. Hagar was from Egypt.

Taĩto: Icimairi arĩ na nciarwa.

Genesis 25:12 Icimairi a-rĩ mũbĩcĩ wa Iburaimu na wa Agai. Agai a-rĩ nkombo ya nka ya Cara. A-rĩ wa kuuma Miciri.



Genesis 25:13 Ishmael had sons named Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, and Mibsam. Nebaioth was Ishmael's first son.

Genesis 25:13 Icimairi a-gĩre na abĩcĩ metagwa Nebaiothi, Kendari, Andubiri, na Mibucamu. Nebaiothi a-rĩ mũbĩcĩ wa mbere wa Icimairi.



Genesis 25:14 Ishmael had other sons named Mishma, Dumah, and Massa.

Genesis 25:14 Icimairi a-gĩre na abĩcĩ mangĩ metagwa Micima, Nduma, na Maca.



Genesis 25:15 And Ishmael also had other sons named Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. <<Kedemah was Ishmael's youngest son.>>

Genesis 25:15 Na Icimairi a-gĩre na abĩcĩ mangĩ metagwa Andandi, Teema, Njeturi, Nabici, na Kendema. <<Kendema a-rĩ mũbĩcĩ ũrĩa mũnini bururu wa Icimairi.>>



Genesis 25:16 Those men were Ishmael's sons. Those twelve sons became the leaders of twelve tribes.

Genesis 25:16 Antũ mau ma-rĩ abĩcĩ ma Icimairi. Abĩcĩ mau ĩkũmi na maĩrĩ ma-tuĩkire atongoria a mĩĩrĩga ĩkũmi na ĩĩrĩ.



Genesis 25:17 When Ishmael was 137 years old, he died. Literal Alternate: Then he was with his ancestors.

Genesis 25:17 Rĩrĩa Icimairi a-rĩ na mĩaka ĩgana rĩa mĩrongo ĩthatũ na mũgwanja, a-kuire. <Literal Alternate: Rĩu a-rĩ na cũcũ mawe.>



Genesis 25:18 Ishmael's descendants lived in many places that were between Havilah and Shur. That region was close to the eastern border of Egypt. Ishmael's descendants attacked each other often.

Genesis 25:18 Nciarwa cia Icimairi cia-tũũraga gũntũ kwĩngĩ kũrĩa kwa-rĩ gatagatĩ ka Abira na Cuuri. Gĩcigo kĩu kĩa-rĩ bakubĩ na mũbaka wa Miciri wa mbarĩ ĩrĩa riũa rĩrathaga. Nciarwa cia Icimairi nĩ cia-tharĩkanangagĩra.



Title: Isaac has descendants.

Genesis 25:19 Isaac was Abraham's son.

Taĩto: Icaka arĩ na nciarwa.

Genesis 25:19 A-rĩ Icaka mũbĩcĩ wa Iburaimu.



Genesis 25:20 When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah. Rebekah was Bethuel's daughter and was Laban's sister. Bethuel was from Paddan Aram. Footnote: Paddan Aram was in northwestern Mesopotamia.

Genesis 25:20 Rĩrĩa Icaka a-rĩ na mĩaka mĩrongo ĩna, a-gũrire Rebeka. Rebeka a-rĩ mwarĩ wa Mbethueri na a-rĩ mwarĩ wa maitũ wa Rabani. Mbethueri a-rĩ wa kuuma Bandani Aramu. 

Footnote: Bandani Aramu ya-rĩ Mecobotamia ya ĩgũrũ erekerete kũ riũa rĩrathaga.



Genesis 25:21 Isaac prayed to the LORD for Rebekah because she wasn't able to become pregnant. Then the LORD answered Isaac's prayer. So Rebekah became pregnant.

Genesis 25:21 Icaka a-rombere Rebeka Mwathani nĩ ũntũ ata-bota kũgĩa na nda. Rĩu Mwathani akĩĩgua ĩromba rĩa Icaka. Kwogu Rebeka akĩgĩa na nda.



Genesis 25:22 Two babies were in Rebekah's womb while she was pregnant. Before Rebekah gave birth to those two babies, they fought each other. Rebekah asked the LORD, “Why do the babies that are in my womb fight each other?”

Genesis 25:22 Twana twĩrĩ ndani ya Rebeka rĩrĩa a-rĩ na nda. Mbere ya Rebeka a-gĩa na twana twĩrĩ, twa-rũanaga. Rebeka akĩũria Mwathani atĩrĩ, “Twana tũrĩa ndani yakwa tũrũanĩte natu nĩkĩ?”



Genesis 25:23 Then the LORD said to Rebekah, “Two nations are in your womb. You'll give birth to two sons. And each son will lead a group of people. One group will be stronger than the other group. And the older son will serve the younger son.”

Genesis 25:23 Rĩu Mwathani akĩĩra Rebeka atĩrĩ, “Nthĩ ciĩrĩ irĩ ndani yaku. Ũkagĩa na ciana ciĩrĩ cia tũbĩcĩ. Na wa mũbĩcĩ agatongoria gĩkundi kĩa antũ. Gĩkundi kĩmwe gĩkegua kĩrĩ na binya tĩ gĩkundi kĩu kĩngĩ. Na mũbĩcĩ ũnu mũkũrũ akerutĩra mũbĩcĩ mũnini wĩra.”



Genesis 25:24 Later Rebekah gave birth to twin boys.

Genesis 25:24 Rebeka a-ciokire akĩgĩa na tũbĩcĩ twa mũbatha.



Genesis 25:25 The first baby that Rebekah gave birth to was red. The first baby's skin had many hairs like a coat has many hairs. So Isaac and Rebekah named that boy Esau. Footnote: 'Esau' means 'hairs'.

Genesis 25:25 Kana ka mbere karĩa Rebeka a-gĩre nako ka-rĩ katuune. Mwĩrĩ wa kana ka mbere wa-rĩ na njuĩrĩ mĩngĩ ta bũrĩa ĩgooti rĩmwe rĩrĩ na njuĩrĩ mĩngĩ. Kwogu Icaka na Rebeka magĩĩta kabĩcĩ kau Ecaũ. 

Footnote: ‘Ecaũ’ nĩ kuuga ‘njuĩrĩ’.



Genesis 25:26 When Rebekah gave birth to the second baby, he was holding Esau's heel. So Isaac and Rebekah named the second baby Jacob. When Rebekah gave birth to those two boys, Isaac was 60 years old. Footnote: 'Jacob' means 'heel'. Footnote: And 'Jacob' also means 'to deceive'.

Genesis 25:26 Rĩrĩa Rebeka a-gĩre na kana ka kaĩrĩ, nĩ ka-mbatagĩrĩra nchũng’ua ya Ecaũ. Kwogu Icaka na Rebeka magĩĩta kana ka kaĩrĩ Njakubu. Rĩrĩa Rebeka a-gĩre na tũbĩcĩ twĩrĩ, Icaka a-rĩ na mĩaka mĩrongo ĩthanthatũ. 

Footnote: ‘Njakubu’ nĩ kuuga ‘nchũng’ua’. Footnote: Na ‘Njakubu’ nĩ kuuga ‘kũbenia’.



Genesis 25:27 After those two boys grew up, Esau hunted animals well. He liked staying in the fields where he hunted animals. But Jacob was quiet. He liked staying near his family's tents.

Genesis 25:27 Tũbĩcĩ twĩrĩ tũgũkũra, Ecaũ a-gwĩmire nyamũ wega. E-ndire e-karire ithakani kũrĩa a-gwĩmire nyamũ. Ĩndĩ Njakubu a-kirire. E-ndire e-karire bakubĩ na magema ma mũciĩ wawe.



Genesis 25:28 Isaac, who ate the meat of the animals that Esau hunted, loved him <<more than he loved Jacob>>. But Rebekah loved Jacob <<more than she loved Esau>>.

Genesis 25:28 Icaka, ũrĩa a-rĩre nyama ya nyamũ irĩa Ecaũ a-gwĩmire, a-mwendete <<tĩ bũ e-ndete Njakubu>>. Ĩndĩ Rebeka a-mwendete <<tĩ bũ e-ndete Ecaũ>>.



Genesis 25:29 One day Jacob was cooking food. At that time Esau returned from the field where he was hunting animals. He was extremely hungry.

Genesis 25:29 Ntukũ ĩmwe Njakubu nĩ a-rugaga irio. Bĩndĩ ĩnu Ecaũ a-ciokire kuuma kĩthaka kũrĩa a-gwĩmaga nyamũ. A-rĩ mũbũtu mũno.



Genesis 25:30 So Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red food! I'm extremely hungry!” (People called Esau 'Edom'.) Footnote: 'Edom' means 'red'. The food that Jacob was preparing was red. And Esau liked eating red food.

Genesis 25:30 Kwogu Ecaũ akĩĩra Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Tiga ndĩe irio inu i ntuune! Ndĩ mũbũtu mũno!” (Antũ me-tire Ecaũ ‘Endomu’.) 

Footnote: ‘riĩtwa Endomu’ nĩ kuuga ‘mũtuune’. Irio irĩa Njakubu a-baaragia cia-rĩ ntuune. Na Ecaũ e-ndire a-rĩre irio i ntuune.



Genesis 25:31 But Jacob said, “I'll trade this food for all of the rights that you received from our father because you're the firstborn son.”

Genesis 25:31 Ĩndĩ Njakubu akiuga atĩrĩ, “Nkendia irio ino ibooto cionthe irĩa wa-mũkĩre kuuma kwa ĩthe wetũ nĩ ũntũ ũrĩ ĩrikithathi.”



Genesis 25:32 Esau said, “I'll die soon <<because I'm extremely hungry>>. If I die, I won't need the rights that I received from my father.”

Genesis 25:32 Ecaũ akiuga atĩrĩ, “Ngakua rua <<nĩ ũntũ ndĩ mũbũtu mũno>>. Ũkegua ngakua, ntĩbatara ibooto irĩa na-mũkĩre kuuma kwa ĩthe wakwa.”



Genesis 25:33 But Jacob said, “Swear to me that you'll give all of your rights to me.” So Esau swore to Jacob that he would give all of his rights to Jacob.

Genesis 25:33 Ĩndĩ Njakubu akiuga atĩrĩ, “Ĩbĩta mbere yakwa ũkanenkera ibooto ciaku cionthe.” Kwogu Ecaũ akĩĩbĩta mbere ya Njakubu akamũnenkera ibooto ciawe cionthe.



Genesis 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and the food that he prepared. And Esau ate that food and drank water. Then he stood up and left that place. So he gave Jacob all of the rights that he received from his father because he was the firstborn son.

Genesis 25:34 Rĩu Njakubu akĩnenkera Ecaũ mũgate na irio irĩa abaaririe. Na Ecaũ a-rĩre irio inu na akĩnyua rũncĩ. Rĩu akĩrũngama na akiuma kũu. Kwogu akĩnenkera Njakubu ibooto cionthe irĩa a-mũkĩrĩte kuuma kwa ĩthe wawe nĩ ũntũ a-rĩ ĩrikithathi.





Title: Isaac lies to Abimelech.

Genesis 26:1 In those days there was another famine in that region. (Before Abraham died, there was a famine in that same region.) So Isaac went to a man named Abimelech. Abimelech was the king of the Philistines at Gerar.

Taĩto: Icaka kũbenia Abimereki.

Genesis 26:1 Matukũni mau kwa-rĩ na yũũra rĩngĩ gĩcigoni kĩu. (Mbere ya Iburaimu a-kua, kwa-rĩ gĩcigoni kĩu kĩmwe.) Kwogu Icaka akĩthiĩ kũrĩ mũntũ wetagwa Abimereki. Abimereki a-rĩ mũthamaki a abirictia Ngerari.



Genesis 26:2 <<After Isaac arrived in Gerar,>> the LORD appeared to him. And the LORD said to Isaac, “Don't go to Egypt. Live in the land where I'll tell you to live.

Genesis 26:2 <<Icaka agũkinya Ngerari,>> Mwathani nĩ a-muumĩrĩre. Na akĩĩra Icaka atĩrĩ, “Ũtĩkathiĩ Miciri. Tũũra nthĩ kũrĩa ngakwĩra ũtũũre.



Genesis 26:3 Stay in this land. I'll be with you and bless you. I'll give all of this land to you and your descendants and do all of the things that I promised your father Abraham that I would do.

Genesis 26:3 Ĩkara nthĩ ĩno. Nkegua ndĩ negwe na ngakũtharimaga. Ngakũnenkera na nciarwa ciaku mũgũnda ũyũ ũnthe. Na nkarũtha maũntũ monthe marĩa na-igire kĩrĩĩko na Iburaimu, tawe ĩbagu atĩ nkarũtha.



Genesis 26:4 I'll cause you to have many descendants. <<There are many stars in the heavens.>> The number of your descendants will be like the number of the stars that are in the heavens. And I will give all of this land to your descendants. All of the nations that are on the earth will be blessed through your descendants.

Genesis 26:4 Ngatũma ũgĩe na nciarwa mĩngĩ. <<Kũrĩ na ndata mĩngĩ ĩgũrũ.>> Kĩthimi kĩa nciarwa ciaku gĩkegua kĩrĩ ta kĩthimi kĩa ndata irĩa irĩ ĩgũrũ. Na nkanenkera nciarwa ciaku nthĩ ĩno yonthe. Nthĩ cionthe irĩa irĩ gũkũ nthĩ ikatharimwa kũbetũkĩrĩra nciarwa ciaku.



Genesis 26:5 I'll do these things because Abraham obeyed me. Abraham obeyed my commands, my laws, and my instructions.”

Genesis 26:5 Nkarũtha maũntũ mama nĩ ũntũ Iburaimu nĩ a-mbathĩkĩrĩte. Iburaimu a-thĩkĩrĩrie atha ciakwa, atho akwa, na mataaro makwa.”



Genesis 26:6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar.

Genesis 26:6 Kwogu Icaka agĩĩkara Ngerari.



Genesis 26:7 <<Isaac's wife named Rebekah was very beautiful.>> One day the men who were living in Gerar asked Isaac about Rebekah. So Isaac said to those men, “Rebekah is my sister.” He thought that a man might kill him to marry Rebekah because she was beautiful. So Isaac was afraid to tell those men that Rebekah was his wife.

Genesis 26:7 <<Mũka wa Icaka wetagwa Rebeka a-rĩ na ũthaka mũno.>> Ntukũ ĩmwe antũ marĩa ma-tũũraga Ngerari ma-ũririe Icaka bwa Rebeka. Kwogu Icaka akĩĩra antũ mau atĩrĩ, “Rebeka nĩ mwarĩ wa maitũ wakwa.” E-ciririe atĩ mũntũ mũrume ũmwe nwa amũũrage nĩ kenda agũre Rebeka nĩ ũntũ a-rĩ na ũthaka. Kwogu akĩmakĩra kwĩra antũ mau atĩ Rebeka a-rĩ mũka wawe.



Genesis 26:8 One day after Isaac had lived in Gerar for several months, Abimelech, who was the king of the Philistines, looked through a window. And he saw Isaac kissing Rebekah.

Genesis 26:8 Ntukũ ĩmwe Icaka agũtũũra Ngerari kabinda ka mĩeri mĩngĩ, Abimereki, ũrĩa wa-rĩ mũthamaki a abirictia, a-cũthire ndirica. Na o-nire Icaka akĩmumunya Rebeka.



Genesis 26:9 Then Abimelech called Isaac and said to him, “Rebekah is your wife! Why did you say, ‘Rebekah is my sister?’” Isaac answered Abimelech, “I was afraid that you'll kill me to marry Rebekah.”

Genesis 26:9 Rĩu Abimereki agĩĩta Icaka na akĩmwĩra atĩrĩ, “Rebeka nĩ mũka waku! Nĩkĩ wa-ugire atĩrĩ, “Rebeka a-rĩ mwarĩ wa maitũ wakwa”?” Icaka agĩciokeria Abimereki atĩrĩ, “Nĩ na-makagĩra ũkambũraga nĩ kenda ngũre Rebeka.”



Genesis 26:10 Then Abimelech said, “Why did you treat us badly? One of the men <<who lives here>> might have slept with your wife. Then we are guilty.”

Genesis 26:10 Rĩu Abimereki akiuga atĩrĩ, “Nĩkĩ wa-tũrũthĩre maũntũ mathũku? Nwa wigue ũmwe wa antũ <<ũrĩa atũũraga gũkũ>> amamire na mũka waku. Tũrĩ agi.”



Genesis 26:11 So Abimelech ordered all of the people not to touch Rebekah. He said to those people, “If a person hurts Isaac or his wife, he'll certainly be killed.”

Genesis 26:11 Kwogu Abimereki akĩatha antũ mau monthe mabũrũr Rebeka. Akĩmera atĩrĩ, “Ũkegua mũntũ ũmwe agũrarĩtie Icaka kana mũka wawe, nwa nkinya aũragwe.”



Title: Isaac becomes rich.

Genesis 26:12 Isaac planted seeds in the ground. And that year he harvested many crops because the LORD blessed him greatly.

Taĩto: Icaka kũgĩa na ũtonga.

Genesis 26:12 Icaka a-bandire mbĩndĩ nthĩ na mwaka ũnu agĩketha maketha mengĩ nĩ ũntũ Mwathani nĩ a-mũtharimĩte mũno.



Genesis 26:13 And Isaac became rich. Each year he harvested many crops <<and bought many slaves>>. <<And he also owned many animals.>> So he became very rich.

Genesis 26:13 Na Icaka a-gĩre na ũtonga. Wa mwaka a-kethire maketha mengĩ <<na akĩgũra nkombo mĩngĩ>>. <<Na a-rĩ na nyamũ mĩngĩ.>> Kwogu akĩgĩa na ũtonga mũno.



Genesis 26:14 The Philistines were jealous of Isaac because he owned many sheep, many cows, and many servants.

Genesis 26:14 Abirictia ma-rĩ Icaka nĩ ũntũ a-rĩ na ng’ondu mĩngĩ, na ng’ombe mĩngĩ, na atũmwa engĩ.



Genesis 26:15 So the Philistines filled with dirt all of the wells that the servants of Isaac's father Abraham dug.

Genesis 26:15 Kwogu abirictia magĩĩcũria ithima cionthe irĩa atũmwa ma ĩthe wa Icaka wetagwa Iburaimu me-njĩte na gĩko.



Genesis 26:16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Leave our country because you're too powerful.”

Genesis 26:16 Na Abimereki akĩĩra Icaka atĩrĩ, “Uma nthĩ yetũ nĩ ũntũ ũrĩ na binya nkũrũki.”



Genesis 26:17 So Isaac left that place. Then he moved to the Valley of Gerar and lived there.

Genesis 26:17 Kwogu Icaka akiuma kũu. Akĩnathamĩrĩra Kĩburo kĩa Geraa agĩtũũraga kũu.



Genesis 26:18 While Abraham was living, his servants had dug many wells in that region. But after Abraham died, the Philistines filled those wells with dirt. So Isaac dug those wells again and named each well the same name that Abraham had named it.

Genesis 26:18 Rĩrĩa Iburaimu a-tũũraga, atũmwa mawe nĩ me-njĩte ithima mĩngĩ gĩcigoni kĩu. Ĩndĩ Iburaimu agũkua, abirictia me-cũririe ithima inu na gĩko. Kwogu Icaka akĩĩnja ithima inu rĩngĩ na agĩĩta wa kĩthima riĩtwa rĩmwe rĩrĩa Iburaimu a-kĩĩtĩte.



Genesis 26:19 One day Isaac's servants dug a well in the valley. There was water in that well.

Genesis 26:19 Ntukũ ĩmwe atũmwa ma Icaka me-njire kĩthima kĩburoni. Kwa-rĩ na rũncĩ kĩthimani kĩu.



Genesis 26:20 But the men who were living in Gerar and were taking care of the animals argued with Isaac's servants about that well. They said to Isaac's servants, “This well belongs to us.” So Isaac named that well Esek because those men argued with him. Footnote: 'Esek' means 'to argue'.

Genesis 26:20 Ĩndĩ antũ marĩa ma-tũũraga Ngerari na mamenyerera nyamũ ma-kararanirie na atũmwa ma Icaka kĩthima kĩu. Makĩĩra atũmwa ma Icaka atĩrĩ, “Kĩthima gĩkĩ nĩ kĩetũ.” Kwogu Icaka agĩĩta kĩthima kĩu Eceki nĩ ũntũ antũ mau nĩ ma-kararanĩtie nawe. 

Footnote: ‘Eceki’ nĩ kuuga ‘gũkararia’.



Genesis 26:21 Then Isaac's servants dug another well. But the people who were living in Gerar also argued with Isaac about that well. So Isaac named that well Sitnah. Footnote: 'Sitnah' means 'to fight'.

Genesis 26:21 Rĩu atũmwa ma Icaka makĩĩnja kĩthima kĩngĩ. Ĩndĩ antũ marĩa ma-tũũraga Ngerari ma-kararanirie na Icaka kĩthima kĩu. Kwogu Icaka agĩĩta kĩthima kĩu Citina. 

Footnote: ‘Citina’ nĩ kuuga ‘kũrũa’.



Genesis 26:22 Then Isaac went to a different place. And Isaac's servants dug another well. The men who were living in Gerar didn't argue with Isaac about that well. So Isaac named that well Rehoboth. He said, “The LORD gave enough land to us now. And we'll become rich here.” Footnote: 'Rehoboth' means 'enough land'.

Genesis 26:22 Rĩu Icaka akĩthiĩ bantũ mwanya. Na atũmwa ma Icaka me-njire kĩthima kĩngĩ. Antũ marĩa ma-tũũraga Ngerari mata-kararania na Icaka kĩthima kĩu. Kwogu Icaka agĩĩta kĩthima kĩu Reobothi. Akiuga atĩrĩ, “Mwathani atũnenkere nthĩ ya kwĩgana rĩu. Na tũkagĩa na ũtonga gũkũ.” 

Footnote: ‘Reobothi’ nĩ kuuga ‘nthĩ ya kwĩgana’.



Genesis 26:23 Then Isaac traveled from there to Beersheba.

Genesis 26:23 Rĩu Icaka akiuma bantũ bau akĩthiĩ Mbethiceba.



Genesis 26:24 That night the LORD appeared to Isaac and said to him, “I'm the God of your father Abraham. Don't be afraid because I'm with you. I'll bless you and cause you to have many descendants because Abraham served me.”

Genesis 26:24 Ũtukũ ũnu Mwathani nĩ a-umĩrĩre Icaka na akĩmwĩra atĩrĩ, “Ndĩ Ngai wa ĩbagu wetagwa Iburaimu. Ũtĩkamake nĩ ũntũ ndĩ negwe. Ngakũtharima. Na ngatũma ũgĩe na nciarwa mĩngĩ nĩ ũntũ Iburaimu nĩ a-ndutĩrĩte wĩra.”



Genesis 26:25 So Isaac built an altar and worshiped the LORD there. Isaac also put his family's tents and the tents of his servants there. And Isaac's servants dug a well.

Genesis 26:25 Kwogu Icaka agĩtuma mathabau na agĩkumia Mwathani kũu. A-igĩre magema ma mũciĩ wawe na magema ma atũmwa mawe kũu. Na atũmwa ma Icaka me-njire kĩthima.



Genesis 26:26 Then Abimelech came from Gerar to talk to Isaac. Abimelech brought Ahuzzath, who advised him, and Phicol, who was the captain of Abimelech's army.

Genesis 26:26 Rĩu Abimereki agĩca kuuma Ngerari nĩ kenda arie na Icaka. A-retire Aucathi, ũrĩa a-mũtaarire, na Bikori, ũrĩa wa-rĩ mũnene wa mbũtũ yawe.



Genesis 26:27 Isaac asked Abimelech, “Why did you come here? You treated me badly and told me to leave your country.”

Genesis 26:27 Icaka akĩũria Abimereki atĩrĩ, “Nĩkĩ ũcire gũkũ? Wa-ndũthĩre maũntũ mathũku na ũkĩmbĩra nyume nthĩ yaku.”



Genesis 26:28 Abimelech answered Isaac, “Now we know that the LORD is with you. So we want to make a treaty with you.

Genesis 26:28 Abimereki agĩciokeria Icaka atĩrĩ, “Tũkũmenya atĩ Mwathani arĩ negwe rĩu. Kwogu tũkwenda kwiga kĩrĩkanĩro negwe.



Genesis 26:29 We want you to promise us that you'll treat us well because we treated you well. And when we told you to leave our country, we weren't angry with you. We know that the LORD blesses you.”

Genesis 26:29 Tũkwenda wige kĩrĩĩko natwi atĩ ũgatũrũthĩra wega nĩ ũntũ nĩ twa-kũrũthĩrĩte wega. Na rĩrĩa twa-kwĩrire uume nthĩ yetũ, tũta-thũrĩtue mũno nĩ weũ. Tũkũmenya atĩ Mwathani akũtharimaga.”



Genesis 26:30 So Isaac prepared a feast for those three men. Then Isaac and those three men ate that meal.

Genesis 26:30 Kwogu Icaka akĩbaarĩria antũ mau mathatũ kĩatho. Icaka na antũ mau mathatũ makĩnarĩa irio inu.



Genesis 26:31 The next morning Isaac and those men made a promise to each other. <<They swore to each other that they would treat each other well.>> Then those three men returned to Gerar peacefully.

Genesis 26:31 Kĩraũko kĩrĩa kĩa-rũmĩrĩrĩte Icaka na antũ mau ma-iganire kĩrĩĩko namo. <<Icaka na antũ mau me-bĩtanire mbere yawe makarũthanĩra wega.>> Rĩu antũ mau mathatũ magĩcioka Ngerari na thaayũ.



Genesis 26:32 That day Isaac's servants told him about the well that they dug. They said, “We found water in that well.”

Genesis 26:32 Ntukũ ĩnu atũmwa ma Icaka ma-mwĩrire bwa kĩthima kĩrĩa menjire. Makiuga atĩrĩ, “Twocire rũncĩ kĩthimani kĩu.”



Genesis 26:33 So Isaac named that well Shibah. And today people call the city that is near that well 'Beersheba'. Footnote: Shibah means 'promise'. Footnote: 'Beersheba' means 'the well of the promise'.

Genesis 26:33 Kwogu Icaka agĩĩta kĩthima kĩu Ciiba. Na ũmũnthi antũ metĩte taũni ĩrĩa ĩrĩ bakubĩ na kĩthima kĩu ‘Mbethiceba’. 

Footnote: Ciiba nĩ kuuga ‘kĩrĩĩko’. Footnote: ‘Mbethiceba’ nĩ kuuga ‘kĩthima gĩa kĩrĩĩko’.



Genesis 26:34 When Esau was forty years old, he married two women who were Hittites. He married Judith, who was Beeri's daughter. And he also married Basemath, who was Elon's daughter.

Genesis 26:34 Rĩrĩa Ecaũ a-rĩ na mĩaka mĩrongo ĩna, a-gũrire aka maĩrĩ marĩa ma-rĩ aitite. A-gũrire Njundĩthi, ũrĩa wa-rĩ mwarĩ wa Beeri, na akĩgũra Bacemathi, ũrĩa wa-rĩ mwarĩ wa Eroni.



Genesis 26:35 But those two women caused Isaac and Rebekah to become very upset.

Genesis 26:35 Ĩndĩ aka mau maĩrĩ ma-tũmire Icaka na Rebeka matuĩka athũũru mũno.





Title: Jacob tricks Isaac.

Genesis 27:1 When Isaac was old, he wasn't able to see well. One day he called his oldest son Esau. Literal Alternate: <<After Esau came to Isaac,>> Isaac said to him, “My son.” Dynamic Alternate: <<After Esau came to Isaac,>> Isaac asked him, “Are you Esau?” End of Alternates. And Esau said to Isaac, Literal Alternate: “I'm here”, Dynamic Alternate: “I'm Esau.”

Taĩto: Njakubu kũbenereria Icaka.

Genesis 27:1 Rĩrĩa Icaka a-rĩ mũkũrũ, ata-bota kwona <<into>> wega. Ntukũ ĩmwe e-tire mũbĩcĩ wawe ũrĩa mũkũrũ bururu wetagwa Ecaũ. <Literal Alternate: <<Ecaũ agũca kũrĩ Icaka,>> akĩmwĩra atĩrĩ, “Mũbĩcĩ wakwa.”> <Dynamic Alternate: <<Ecaũ agũca kũrĩ Icaka,>> akĩmũũria atĩrĩ, “Ũrĩ Ecaũ?”> Na Ecaũ akĩĩra Icaka atĩrĩ <Literal Alternate:, “Ndĩ baba”> Atĩrĩ <Dynamic Alternate:, “Ndĩ Ecaũ”>.



Genesis 27:2 Isaac said, “I'm old now and will die soon.

Genesis 27:2 Icaka akiuga atĩrĩ, “Ndĩ mũkũrũ rĩu. Na ngakua rua.



Genesis 27:3 So get your bow and your arrows and go to a field to hunt a wild animal for me.

Genesis 27:3 Kwogu gĩa ũta waku na mĩguĩ yaku. Na ũkĩnathiĩ mũgũndani kũgwĩma nyamũ ya kĩthaka niũ.



Genesis 27:4 <<Cook that animal.>> And prepare a delicious meal for me. Then bring that food to me so that I can eat it. Before I die, I'll bless you.”

Genesis 27:4 <<Ruga nyamũ ĩnu.>> Na ũkĩnambaarĩria irio mbega. Rĩu ũkĩnareta irio inu nĩ kenda nkarĩa irio inu. Mbere ya nkua, ngakũtharima.”



Genesis 27:5 But Rebekah heard Isaac talking to his son Esau. Then Esau went to a field to hunt an animal.

Genesis 27:5 Ĩndĩ Rebeka e-guire Icaka akĩaria na mũbĩcĩ wawe wetagwa Ecaũ. Rĩu Ecaũ akĩthiĩ kĩthakani kũgwĩma nyamũ.



Genesis 27:6 So Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Listen to me. I heard your father talking to your brother Esau.

Genesis 27:6 Kwogu Rebeka akĩĩra mũbĩcĩ wawe wetagwa Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Nthikĩrĩria. Nĩ mbĩguire ĩbagu akĩaria na mũruanyũkwe wetagwa Ecaũ.



Genesis 27:7 Isaac said to Esau, “Hunt an animal for me and cook him. Then prepare a delicious meal for me. Before I die, I'll bless you. The LORD will witness me blessing you.””

Genesis 27:7 Icaka akĩĩra Ecaũ atĩrĩ, “Gwĩma nyamũ niũ. Na mĩruga. Rĩu ũkĩnambaarĩria irio mbega. Mbere ya nkua, ngakũtharima. Mwathani akegua arĩ mwira ngĩkũtharima.””



Genesis 27:8 Then Rebekah said to Jacob, “My son, listen to me carefully and obey me.

Genesis 27:8 Rĩu Rebeka akĩĩra Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Mũbĩcĩ wakwa, nthikĩrĩria ũkĩmenyagĩrĩra. Na mbathĩkĩra.



Genesis 27:9 Go to the flock of sheep and bring two of our young goats to me. <<I'll kill those goats <<and cook them>>.>> Then I'll prepare a delicious meal for your father.

Genesis 27:9 Thiĩ ng’onduni mĩngĩ ũkarete mbũri cietũ ciĩrĩ irĩa nini gatĩ ka mbũri. <<Ngaciĩũraga.>> <<Na ngaciĩruga.>> Rĩu nkabaarĩria ĩbagu irio mbega.



Genesis 27:10 Then take that food to your father. Then before your father dies, he'll bless you.”

Genesis 27:10 Rĩu ũkĩnabirĩra ĩbagu irio inu. Rĩu mbere ya ĩbagu akua, agakũtharima.”



Genesis 27:11 Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, “But Esau's body is covered by many hairs. My body isn't covered by many hairs.

Genesis 27:11 Njakubu akĩĩra ng’ina wawe wetagwa Rebeka atĩrĩ, “Ĩndĩ ĩgũrũ rĩa mwĩrĩ wa Ecaũ ũrĩ nĩ njuĩrĩ mĩngĩ. Ĩgũrũ rĩa mwĩrĩ wakwa nĩ njuĩrĩ mĩngĩ.



Genesis 27:12 If my father touches me, he'll know that I'm not Esau. Then my father won't bless me. My father will curse me because I tried to trick him.”

Genesis 27:12 Ũkegua ĩthe wakwa akambũrũria, akamenya ntĩ Ecaũ. Rĩu atĩgantharima. Akancenga nĩ ũntũ nĩ ngeririe kũmũbenereria.”



Genesis 27:13 But Rebekah said to Jacob, “My son, if your father curses you, he'll curse me instead of you. <<You won't be cursed by your father.>> So obey me now. Go to the field and bring two goats to me.”

Genesis 27:13 Ĩndĩ Rebeka akĩĩra Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Mũbĩcĩ wakwa, ũkegua ĩbagu agagũcenga, akancenga. <<Ũtĩcengwa nĩ ĩbagu.>> Kwogu rĩu mbathĩkĩra. Thiĩ kĩthakani ũkarete mbũri ciĩrĩ.”



Genesis 27:14 So Jacob went to the flock of sheep and brought two goats to his mother. Then Rebekah cooked those goats and prepared a delicious meal for Isaac.

Genesis 27:14 Kwogu Njakubu akĩthiĩ ng’onduni mĩngĩ na akĩretera ng’ina wawe mbũri ciĩrĩ. Rĩu Rebeka agĩciĩruga na akĩbaarĩria Icaka irio mbega.



Genesis 27:15 Then Rebekah brought her older son's best clothes to her younger son Jacob. And Jacob put those clothes on.

Genesis 27:15 Rĩu Rebeka akĩretera mũbĩcĩ wawe mũnini wetagwa Njakubu nguo irĩa mbega bururu cia mũbĩcĩ wawe mũkũrũ. Na Njakubu e-kĩre nguo inu.



Genesis 27:16 Rebekah also put those two goats' skins on Jacob's hands and on his neck. <<Those two goats' skins had many hairs.>>

Genesis 27:16 Rebeka a-igĩrĩre mĩĩrĩ ya mbũri inu ciĩrĩ njara cia Njakubu na nkingo yawe. <<Mĩĩrĩ ya mbũri inu ciĩrĩ ya-rĩ na njuĩrĩ mĩngĩ.>>



Genesis 27:17 Then Rebekah told her son Jacob to take the delicious food and the bread that she baked to Isaac.

Genesis 27:17 Rĩu Rebeka akĩĩra mũbĩcĩ wawe wetagwa Njakubu abirĩre Icaka irio mbega na mũgate ũrĩa arugire.



Genesis 27:18 So Jacob went to Isaac Primary: And said to him, “My Father.” Alternate 1: And Jacob said to Isaac, “Isaac.” End of Alternates. Primary: Isaac said to Jacob, “My son.” Alternate 1: Isaac said to Jacob, “Yes?” End of Alternates. Then Isaac asked Jacob, “Who are you?”

Genesis 27:18 Kwogu Njakubu akĩthiĩ kũrĩ Icaka <Primary: Na akĩmwĩra atĩrĩ, “Baba wakwa,”>. <Primary: Icaka akĩĩra Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Mũbĩcĩ wakwa.”> <Alternate 1: Icaka a-ciokerie Njakubu, “Ĩĩ.”> Rĩu akĩũria Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Weũ ũrĩ ũ?”



Genesis 27:19 Then Jacob said to his father, “I'm your firstborn son Esau. I obeyed you. Please sit up now so that you could eat this meal that I prepared for you. Then you may bless me.”

Genesis 27:19 Rĩu Njakubu akĩĩra ĩthe wawe atĩrĩ, “Ndĩ ĩrikithathi rĩaku tagwa Ecaũ. Nĩ nkwathĩkĩre. Rĩu bai uũkĩrĩre nĩ kenda ũkarĩa irio ino irĩa na-kũbaarĩrie. Rĩu nwa ũntharime.”



Genesis 27:20 But Isaac asked his son, “My son, how did you find this animal very quickly?” Jacob answered Isaac, “The LORD your God helped me find this animal.”

Genesis 27:20 Ĩndĩ Icaka akĩũria mũbĩcĩ wawe atĩrĩ, “Mũbĩcĩ wakwa, wĩthĩrĩre nyamũ ĩno na karũgĩ mũno atĩa?” Njakubu agĩciokeria Icaka atĩrĩ, “Mwathani Ngai waku antethererie kwĩthĩrĩra nyamũ ĩno.”



Genesis 27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “My son, come to me so that I can touch you. Then I'll know that you're my son Esau.”

Genesis 27:21 Rĩu Icaka akĩĩra Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Mũbĩcĩ wakwa, ncũ kũrĩ niũ nĩ kenda ngakũbũrũria. Rĩu nkĩnamenya ũrĩ mũbĩcĩ wakwa wetagwa Ecaũ.”



Genesis 27:22 So Jacob went near his father Isaac. Then Isaac touched Jacob's hands and said, “Your voice sounds like Jacob's voice. But your hands have many hairs like Esau's hands have many hairs.”

Genesis 27:22 Kwogu Njakubu agĩkinya bakubĩ na ĩthe wawe wetagwa Icaka. Rĩu Icaka akĩbũrũria njara cia Njakubu na akiuga atĩrĩ, “Mũgambo waku ũgambĩte ta mũgambo wa Njakubu. Ĩndĩ njara ciaku irĩ na njuĩrĩ mĩngĩ ta bũrĩa njara cia Ecaũ irĩ na njuĩrĩ mĩngĩ.”



Genesis 27:23 So Isaac didn't know that this son was Jacob because those two goats' hairs were covering his hands. So Isaac decided to bless Jacob.

Genesis 27:23 Kwogu Icaka ata-menya atĩ mũbĩcĩ ũyũ a-rĩ Njakubu nĩ ũntũ njuĩrĩ cia mbũri inu ciĩrĩ nĩ cia-kunĩkagĩra njara cia Njakubu. Kwogu akĩbanga kũtharima Njakubu.



Genesis 27:24 But Isaac asked Jacob, “Are you my son Esau?” And Jacob answered Isaac, “Yes. I'm Esau.”

Genesis 27:24 Ĩndĩ Icaka akĩũria Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Ũrĩ mũbĩcĩ wakwa wetagwa Ecaũ?” Na Njakubu a-ciokirie Icaka, “Ĩĩ. Ndĩ Ecaũ.”



Genesis 27:25 Then Isaac said, “My son, bring some food to me. I'll eat that food. Then I'll bless you.” So Jacob brought some food to Isaac. And Isaac ate that food. Jacob also brought some wine to Isaac. And Isaac drank that wine.

Genesis 27:25 Rĩu Icaka akiuga atĩrĩ, “Mũbĩcĩ wakwa, rete irio. Nkarĩa irio inu. Rĩu ngakũtharima.” Kwogu Njakubu akĩretera Icaka irio. Na Icaka a-rĩre irio inu. Njakubu a-retere Icaka ndibei. Na Icaka a-mĩnyuire.



Genesis 27:26 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “My son, come near me and kiss me.”

Genesis 27:26 Rĩu Icaka akĩĩra Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Mũbĩcĩ wakwa, ncũ bakubĩ nani ũmmumunye.”



Genesis 27:27 So Jacob went to his father and kissed him. After Isaac smelled Esau's clothes, he blessed Jacob. Isaac said, “When I smell my son, I smell a field that the LORD blessed.

Genesis 27:27 Kwogu Njakubu akĩthiĩ kũrĩ ĩthe wawe na akĩmũmumunya. Icaka akũnunkĩra nguo cia Ecaũ, a-tharimire Njakubu. Akiuga atĩrĩ, “Rĩrĩa nunkĩrĩte mũbĩcĩ wakwa, nĩ nunkĩrĩte mũgũnda ũrĩa Mwathani a-tharimire.



Genesis 27:28 May God give enough rain to you and give good soil to you. And may you have a lot of grain and new wine.

Genesis 27:28 Ngai arokwĩnenkera mbura ya kwĩgana. Na arokũnenkera mũthetu mwega. Na nĩ na ngano mĩngĩ na ndibei njerũ.



Genesis 27:29 May nations serve you. And may many people bow to you. Become your brother's master. And may your mother's sons bow to you. May the people who curse you be cursed. And may the people who bless you be blessed.”

Genesis 27:29 Nthĩ irokũrutĩra wĩra. Na antũ engĩ marogũkwamĩrĩra. Tuĩka mũnene wa mũruanyũkwe. Na abĩcĩ ma nyũkwe marogũkwamĩrĩra. Antũ marĩa magũcengete marorumwa. Na antũ marĩa makũtharimĩte marotharimwa.”



Genesis 27:30 After Isaac finished blessing Jacob, Jacob left his father. Then Esau returned from that field.

Genesis 27:30 Icaka akũrĩkia kũtharima Njakubu, nĩ a-tigire ĩthe wawe. Rĩu Ecaũ agĩcioka kuuma kĩthaka kĩu.



Genesis 27:31 <<Esau cooked the animal that he killed.>> And Esau prepared a delicious meal for his father. Then Esau brought that food to his father and said to him, “My father, please sit up. And eat this food that I prepared for you. Then you may bless me.”

Genesis 27:31 <<Ecaũ a-rugire nyamũ ĩrĩa a-ũragire.>> Na a-baarĩrie ĩthe wawe irio mbega. Rĩu akĩretera ĩthe wawe irio inu na akĩmwĩra atĩrĩ, “Baba wakwa, bai uũkĩrĩre. Na rĩa irio ino irĩa nkũbaarĩrie. Rĩu nwa ũntharime.”



Genesis 27:32 But Isaac asked Esau, “Who are you?” Esau answered, “I'm your firstborn son Esau.”

Genesis 27:32 Ĩndĩ Icaka akĩũria Ecaũ atĩrĩ, “Weũ ũrĩ ũ?” Ecaũ agĩciokia, “Ndĩ ĩrikithathi rĩaku tagwa Ecaũ.”



Genesis 27:33 Then Isaac's body started shaking. <<And Isaac became very upset.>> And he said to Esau, “Before you came into my tent, who brought food to me? I ate that food and blessed that person. And that person will certainly be blessed!”

Genesis 27:33 Rĩu mwĩrĩ wa Icaka ũkĩambĩrĩria kwinaina. <<Na Icaka a-tuĩkire mũthũũru mũno.>> Na akĩĩra Ecaũ atĩrĩ, “Mbere ya ũca ĩgemani rĩakwa, nũũ aretire irio? Nĩ ndĩre irio inu na nĩ natharimire mũntũ ũnu. Na mũntũ ũnu nwa nkinya atharimwe!”



Genesis 27:34 When Esau heard his father's words, he started crying loudly. Then he said to his father, “My father, bless me also!”

Genesis 27:34 Rĩrĩa Ecaũ e-guire ciugo cia ĩthe wawe, a-mbĩrĩrie kũrĩra wĩca. Rĩu akĩĩra ĩthe wawe atĩrĩ, “Baba wakwa, manawe tharima!”



Genesis 27:35 But Isaac said to Esau, “Your brother tricked me! Jacob caused me to bless him instead of you.”

Genesis 27:35 Ĩndĩ Icaka akĩĩra Ecaũ atĩrĩ, “Mũruanyũkwe ambenererie! Njakubu atũmire mũtharima.”



Genesis 27:36 Then Esau said, “You named my brother Jacob correctly. Jacob tricked me two times. Jacob made me promise him that I'll give him all of the rights that I have because I'm the firstborn son. And today Jacob caused you to bless him instead of me!” Then Esau asked Isaac, “Will you also bless me?” Footnote: 'Jacob' means 'to deceive'.

Genesis 27:36 Rĩu Ecaũ akiuga atĩrĩ, “We-tire ĩtĩkĩrĩka mũruang’ina wakwa Njakubu. Njakubu a-mbenererie. A-tũmire mbige kĩrĩĩko nawe atĩ nkamũnenkera ibooto cionthe irĩa ndĩ nacio nĩ ũntũ ndĩ ĩrikithathi. Na ũmũnthi atũmire ũmũtharima!” Rĩu Ecaũ akĩũria Icaka atĩrĩ, “Ũgantharima?” 

Footnote: ‘Njakubu’ nĩ kuuga ‘kũbenia’.



Genesis 27:37 Isaac answered Esau, “I already said that Jacob will become your master. And all of Jacob's relatives will become his servants. And God will bless Jacob by giving a lot of grain and a lot of wine to him. My son, what might I give to you?”

Genesis 27:37 Icaka agĩciokeria Ecaũ atĩrĩ, “Nĩ mbugire Njakubu agatuĩka mũnene waku. Na antũ monthe ma mũciĩ wa Njakubu magatuĩka atũmwa mawe. Na Ngai akatharima Njakubu na gũkundia Njakubu ngano mĩngĩ na ndibei mĩngĩ. Mũbĩcĩ wakwa, nĩ indũ nwa nkũnenkere?”



Genesis 27:38 But Esau said to his father, “My father, are you able to bless only one person? My father, please also bless me!” Then Esau started weeping again.

Genesis 27:38 Ĩndĩ Ecaũ akĩĩra ĩthe wawe atĩrĩ, “Baba wakwa, nwa ũbote kũtharima mũntũ ũmwe yonka? Baba wakwa, bai ũntharime!” Rĩu Ecaũ akĩambĩrĩria kũrĩra rĩngĩ.



Genesis 27:39 So Isaac said to Esau, “You'll live far away from the best land of the earth. It won't rain often at the place where you'll live.

Genesis 27:39 Kwogu Icaka akĩĩra Ecaũ atĩrĩ, “Ũgatũũra nthĩ ĩrĩa mbega bururu ya nthĩ. Gũtiura kũrĩa ũgatũũra.



Genesis 27:40 You'll need your sword to fight many people. And you'll serve your brother. Literal Alternate: But when you want to leave Jacob, you'll break his yoke that is on your neck.” Dynamic Alternate: But when you want to leave Jacob, you'll stop serving him.”

Genesis 27:40 Ũkabatara rũbiũ rwaku nĩ kenda ũrũe na antũ engĩ. Na ũkarutĩra mũruanyũkwe wĩra. <Literal Alternate: Ĩndĩ rĩrĩa ũkenda gũtiga Njakubu, ũkauna ĩcoki rĩawe rĩrĩa rĩrĩ nkingoni yaku.”> <Dynamic Alternate: Ĩndĩ rĩrĩa ũkenda gũtiga Njakubu, ũgatiga kũmũrutĩra wĩra.”>



Genesis 27:41 Then Esau hated Jacob because Isaac blessed Jacob instead of him. Esau thought, “After I finish mourning for my father, I'll kill my brother Jacob.”

Genesis 27:41 Rĩu Ecaũ akĩmena Njakubu nĩ ũntũ Icaka nĩ a-mũtharimĩte. E-ciririe, “Rĩrĩa nkarĩkia kũrĩria ĩthe wakwa, nkaũraga mũruang’ina wakwa wetagwa Njakubu.”



Genesis 27:42 But Rebekah found out that Esau wanted to kill Jacob. So she called her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to kill you.

Genesis 27:42 Ĩndĩ Rebeka a-menyire Ecaũ e-ndaga kũũraga Njakubu. Kwogu agĩĩta mũbĩcĩ wawe mũnini wetagwa Njakubu na akĩĩra Njakubu atĩrĩ, “Mũruanyũkwe wetagwa Ecaũ nĩ akũbanga gũkũũraga.



Genesis 27:43 My son, go immediately to my brother Laban. Laban is living in Haran.

Genesis 27:43 Mũbĩcĩ wakwa, thiĩni kũrĩ mũruang’ina wakwa wetagwa Rabani warĩo. Rabani nĩ agũtũũra Arani.



Genesis 27:44 Stay with Laban until your brother stops being angry.

Genesis 27:44 Ĩkara na Rabani nkinya mũruanyũkwe athũre.



Genesis 27:45 Your brother will forget that you caused your father to bless you. So after Esau stops being angry with you, I'll send a servant who will bring you here. Why should my two sons die on the same day?”

Genesis 27:45 Mũruanyũkwe akariganĩrwa atĩ ũtũmire ĩbagu akũtharima. Kwogu rĩrĩa Ecaũ akathũrua mũno nĩ weũ, ngatũma mũtũmwa ũmwe ũrĩa agakũreta baba. Abĩcĩ makwa maĩrĩ magakua ntukũ ĩmwe nĩkĩ?”



Genesis 27:46 Later Rebekah said to Isaac, “I don't like these Hittite women. If Jacob marries a Hittite woman who lives here, I'll want to die.”

Genesis 27:46 Rebeka a-ciokire akĩĩra Icaka atĩrĩ, “Ntĩendete aka mama aitite. Ũkegua Njakubu akagũra mũka ũmwe mũitite ũrĩa atũũraga gũkũ, nkenda gũkua.”
