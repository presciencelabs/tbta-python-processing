Title: Elimelech and Naomi move from Bethlehem to Moab.
Ruth 1:1 When judges were ruling Israel, there was a famine in Israel. A certain man was from Bethlehem, which was in Judah. That man, his wife, and his two sons moved from Bethlehem to a country named Moab to live there for a few years.

Ruth 1:2 That man's name was Elimelech. Elimelech's wife's name was Naomi. One son's name was Mahlon. And the other son's name was Kilion. Elimelech and Naomi were in Ephrah's clan. That family was living in a town named Bethlehem, which was in Judah. But they went to a country named Moab and lived there.

Ruth 1:4 Those sons married women who were from Moab. One son married a woman named Orpah. And the other son married a woman named Ruth. That family continued living in Moab for about ten years.

Ruth 1:5 Then Mahlon and Kilion also died. So Naomi didn't have her sons or her husband.
Ruthu 1:5 Rĩu Maroni na Kirioni wanamo magĩkua. Kwogu Naomi agĩtigwa atĩna nthaka ciawe kana mũrũme wawe.

Ruth 1:6 While Naomi was living in Moab, she heard that the LORD was taking care of his people who were in Israel. The LORD was giving food to those people. So Naomi prepared to return to Bethlehem. Naomi's daughters-in-law also prepared to go to Bethlehem with her.
Ruthu 1:6 Rĩrĩa Naomi a-tũũraga Moabu, nĩ e-guire Mwathani nĩ a-menyagĩrĩra antũ mawe ma-rĩ Iciraeri. Mwathani nĩ a-nenkagĩra antũ mau irio. Kwogu Naomi akĩbarĩria gũcioka Bethireemu. Aka ma nthaka cia Naomi wanamo nĩ me-barĩrie kũthiĩ Bethireemu nawe.

Ruthu 1:8 Ĩndĩ Naomi nĩ e-rire aka ma nthaka ciawe ciĩrĩ, “Ciarĩ ciakwa, ciokani nyombani cia manyũkwe. Mwathani aromũtuga ta bũrĩa mwa-tugaga arũme menu akuũ na mwa-ntugaga.

Ruth 1:9 May the LORD give new husbands to you so that you can rest.” Then Naomi kissed her daughters-in-law. And Naomi and her daughters-in-law wept loudly.
Ruthu 1:9 Mwathani aromũba arũme mangĩ nĩ kenda mũnogoka.” Naomi akĩnamumunya aka ma nthaka ciawe. Naomi na aka ma nthaka ciawe makĩrĩra wĩca.

Ruthu 1:10 Rĩu aka ma nthaka cia Naomi makĩmwĩra, “Nwa nkinya tũthiĩ negwe kũrĩ antũ maku.”

Ruth 1:11 But Naomi said, “My daughters, return to your houses. Why should you come with me? Will I give birth to more sons who will become your husbands?
Ruthu 1:11 Ĩndĩ Naomi a-ugire, “Ciarĩ ciakwa, ciokani nyombani cienu. Nĩkĩ mũkwenda gũca nani? <<Ntĩbota kũmũmenyerera.>> Nkagĩa na ciana cingĩ cia tũbĩcĩ irĩa igatuĩka arũme menu?

Ruth 1:12 My daughters, return to your parents' houses. I'm not able to marry another man because I'm too old. I don't hope to marry another man. Even if I marry a man tonight, and even if I give birth to sons, will you wait for them to grow up?
Ruthu 1:12 Ciarĩ ciakwa, ciokani nyombani cia aciari menu. Ntĩbota kũgũrwa nĩ mũntũ mũrume ũngĩ nĩ ũntũ nĩ mũkũrũ mũno. Ntĩkwĩrĩgĩrĩra kũgũrwa nĩ mũntũ mũrume ũngĩ. Wana nkagũrwa nĩ mũntũ mũrume ũmũnthĩ ũtukũ, na wana nkagĩa na ciana cia tũbĩcĩ, mũgacieterera ikũre?

Ruth 1:14 Then Naomi and her daughters-in-law wept again loudly. Then Orpah kissed Naomi and said goodbye to her. But Ruth hugged Naomi.
Ruthu 1:14 Rĩu Naomi na aka ma nthaka ciawe makĩrĩra wĩca rĩngĩ. Rĩu Oba akĩmumunya Naomi. Na a-mwĩrire atigwe wega. <<Na a-mũtigire.>> Ĩndĩ Ruthu nĩ a-mũkumbatĩrie.

Ruth 1:15 Naomi said to Ruth, “Orpah is returning to her people and her gods. Go with Orpah.”
Ruthu 1:15 Naomi e-rire Ruthu, “Oba nĩka aciokete kũrĩ antũ mawe na kũrĩ ngai ciawe. Thiĩ na Oba.”

Ruth 1:16 But Ruth said to Naomi, “Don't tell me to leave you. Allow me to go with you. I'll go to the place where you'll go. And I will stay at the place where you'll stay. Your people will become my people. And your God will be my God.
Ruthu 1:16 Ĩndĩ Ruthu e-rire Naomi, “Ũtĩkambĩre ngũtige. Mbĩtĩkĩrĩria nthiĩ negwe. Nkathiĩ kũrĩa ũkathiĩ. Na ngekara kũrĩa ũgekara. Antũ maku magatuĩka antũ makwa. Na Ngai waku agatuĩka Ngai wakwa.

Ruth 1:17 I'll die at the place where you'll die. And I will be buried there. I swear to the LORD that I'll stay with you until I die. If I don't keep this promise, the LORD should punish me severely.”
Ruthu 1:17 Ngakuĩra kũrĩa ũgakuĩra. Na nkathikua baarĩa. Nkwĩbĩta kũrĩ Mwathani ngekara negwe nkinya nkue. Ũkegua ntĩbingia kĩrĩĩko gĩkĩ, Mwathani nĩ abatiĩ kũmbũra mũno.”

Ruth 1:18 Naomi realized that Ruth decided to go with her. So Naomi stopped arguing with Ruth.
Ruthu 1:18 Naomi a-menyire atĩ Ruthu nĩ a-bangĩte kũthiĩ nawe. Kwogu agĩtiga gũkararania na Ruthu.

Ruth 1:19 Then Naomi and Ruth continued traveling to Bethlehem. When Naomi and Ruth arrived in Bethlehem, the people who were living there became excited. The women who were living in Bethlehem asked each other, “Is this woman Naomi?”
Ruthu 1:19 Rĩu Naomi na Ruthu makĩthiĩ na mbere kũthiĩ Bethireemu. Rĩrĩa Naomi na Ruthu ma-kinyire Bethireemu, antũ marĩa ma-tũũraga ku magĩkena. Aka marĩa ma-tũũraga Bethireemu nĩ ma-ũranirie, “Mũka ũyũ nĩ Naomi?”

Ruth 1:20 But Naomi said to those people, “Don't call me 'Naomi'. Call me 'Mara' because the LORD Almighty caused me to become very bitter.” But Mara means 'bitter'.
Ruthu 1:20 Ĩndĩ Naomi e-rire antũ mau, “Mũtĩkambĩte ‘Naomi’. Mbĩtani ‘Mara’ nĩ ũntũ Mwathani Mwene Binya Yonthe a-tũmire nagĩe na makanya mũno.” 
Footnote: Riĩtwa Naomi nĩ kuuga ‘mũrĩo’. Ĩndĩ riĩtwa Mara nĩ kuuga ‘makanya’.

Ruth 1:21 Then Naomi said, “When I left Bethlehem, I had many good things. But the LORD took those things away from me. So why should you call me 'Naomi'? The LORD caused me to suffer. The LORD Almighty caused bad things to happen to me.”
Ruthu 1:21 Rĩu Naomi akiuga, “Rĩrĩa na-umire Bethireemu, na-rĩ na into mĩngĩ mbega. Ĩndĩ Mwathani nĩ e-ũkirie into inu kuuma kũrĩ niũ. Kwogu nĩkĩ mũkũmbĩta ‘Naomi’? Mwathani a-tũmire nanyamaare. Mwathani Mwene Binya Yonthe a-tũmire maũntũ mathũku mambĩkarĩkĩre.”

Ruth 1:22 So Naomi returned from Moab. And Ruth, who was from Moab, went to Bethlehem with Naomi. Naomi and Ruth arrived in Bethlehem during the time when people started harvesting barley.
Ruthu 1:22 Kwogu Naomi agĩcioka aumĩte Moabu. Na Ruthu, ũrĩa a-rĩ wa kuuma Moabu, a-thiĩre Bethireemu na Naomi. Naomi na Ruthu nĩ ma-kinyire Bethireemu bĩndĩ ĩrĩa antũ mambagĩrĩria gũketha cairi.
